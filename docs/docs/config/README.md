# Config

## Built-in layouts

### Line

<demoComponent />

Draws the elements in a straight line. The configuration for a line only requires a start and end point, which looks like:

```json
{
    "start": {
      "x": "5%", 
      "y": "5%"
    },
    "end": {
      "x": "95%",
      "y": "95%"
    }
}
```
