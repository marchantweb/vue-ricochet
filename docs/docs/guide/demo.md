# Demo

<demoComponent />

This demo shows several blocks drawn in a diagonal line automatically, which transition into a circle, and then back into a line. This repeats indefinitely using a basic `setInterval` call. The shapes use the default shape configurations, so you won't see any of that in the below code.
